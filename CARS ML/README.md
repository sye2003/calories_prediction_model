# CARS ML Project

## Overview
The CARS ML project is a machine learning application that predicts calorie expenditure based on various features such as duration of exercise, pulse rate, and maximum pulse rate.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CARS ML
   ```
3. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can use pip to install them:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
2. Run the cells to load the data, train the model, and visualize the results.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is located in `data.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- Duration: Duration of exercise in minutes
- Pulse: Average pulse during exercise
- Maxpulse: Maximum pulse during exercise
- Calories: Calories burned
