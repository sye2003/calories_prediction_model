# CARS ML Project

## Overview
The CARS ML project is a machine learning application that predicts calories burned based on exercise duration, pulse, and maximum pulse. The project utilizes a linear regression model to make predictions and visualize the results.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CARS ML
   ```
3. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
4. Place your dataset in the project directory as `data.csv`.
5. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to run the code.

## Usage
- Run the cells in `main.ipynb` to load the data, train the model, and visualize the predictions.
- Modify the input values in the prediction section to test different scenarios.
